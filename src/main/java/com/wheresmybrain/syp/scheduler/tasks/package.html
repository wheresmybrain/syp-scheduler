This package contains abstract base classes for creating custom tasks that
can execute work on a schedule. Extending one of these base classes and adding it
to the TaskScheduler is not as easy as implementing Task and
adding it using one of the TaskScheduler's <i>schedule()</i> methods, but is
necessary if you have to create a task that runs on a custom schedule.
